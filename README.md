# Solutions to *Theory of Probability and Random Processes* by Koralov and Sinai
A collection of my solutions to *Theory of Probability and Random Processes* by Koralov and Sinai. These solutions originate from my own self-study and may contain errors. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you find any errors or have any suggestions. I hope you find these solutions helpful. The LaTeX compiled PDF of all of the solutions can be found in `main.pdf`. Otherwise, I've also compiled a list of what I personally think are important concepts which can be found in `toc/main.pdf`. 

## Progress
This keeps track of the problems that I'm stuck on (and some remarks for each one) and chapters I've finished. 
- [ ] Chapter 1
    - Problem 6. I have no idea how to evaluate the limit here. I've already tried using Stirling's approximation, but this isn't giving me anything that I could work with. Intuitively, I expect the limit to be some Poisson distribution with expected value $n/a$. 
- [ ] Chapter 2

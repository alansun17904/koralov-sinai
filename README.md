# Solutions to *Theory of Probability and Random Processes* by Koralov and Sinai
A collection of my solutions to *Theory of Probability and Random Processes* by Koralov and Sinai. These solutions originate from my own self-study and may contain errors. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you find any errors or have any suggestions. I hope you find these solutions helpful. The LaTeX compiled PDF of all of the solutions can be found in `main.pdf`. Otherwise, I've also compiled a list of what I personally think are important concepts which can be found in `toc/main.pdf`. 

## Progress
This keeps track of the problems that I'm stuck on (and some remarks for each one) and chapters I've finished. 
- Chapter 1: ![100%](https://progress-bar.dev/100)
- Chapter 2: ![78%](https://progress-bar.dev/78)

    - Problem 7. Haven't really thought too much about this one yet.
    - Problem 8. Struggling here. I don't think there is a closed-form solution to this or if there is a cleaner method than simply inclusion-exclusion.

- Chapter 3: ![62%](https://progress-bar.dev/62)
- Chapter 4: ![93%](https://progress-bar.dev/86)

    - Problem 13. Haven't thought too much about this one.

- Chapter 5: ![19%](https://progress-bar.dev/19)
- Chapter 6: ![0%](https://progress-bar.dev/0) *Going to skip these problems for now.*

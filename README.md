# Solutions to *Theory of Probability and Random Processes* by Koralov and Sinai
A collection of my solutions to *Theory of Probability and Random Processes* by Koralov and Sinai. These solutions originate from my own self-study and may contain errors. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you find any errors or have any suggestions. I hope you find these solutions helpful. The LaTeX compiled PDF of all of the solutions can be found in `main.pdf`. Otherwise, I've also compiled a list of what I personally think are important concepts which can be found in `toc/main.pdf`.

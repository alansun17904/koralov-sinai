Some brief notes before the problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \color{brickred}{Koralov and Sinai use $\times$ instead of $\otimes$ for the product $\sigma$-algebra. Moving forward, the reader needs to be cautious about what the operands are. If they are $\sigma$-algebras, we understand the result of the expression to be the aforementioned product.}

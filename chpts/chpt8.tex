\begin{problem}{1}
Let $(X,d)$ be a separable metric space. For $x \in X$, let $\delta_x$ be the measure on $(X, \cB(X))$ which is concentrated at $x$, that is $\delta(A) = 1$ if $x \in A$, $\delta(A) = 0$ if $x \notin A$ for $A \in \cB(X)$. Prove that $\delta_{x_n}$ converges weakly if and only if there is $x \in X$ such that $x_n \to x$ as $n \to \infty$.
